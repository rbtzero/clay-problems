\section{Osterwalder--Seiler reconstruction}\label{YM:os}

Let $\{\mu_{a}\}_{a>0}$ be lattice measures at spacing $a$ with coupling
$\beta(a)$.  From Sect.\,\ref{YM:cluster} the
uniform bound $\sup_{a}\int e^{\kappa S_{\beta(a)}}d\mu_{a}<\infty$ holds
for $\kappa<c_{1}$; thus the family is tight.

\begin{lemma}[OS limit]\label{lemma:os}
Every sequence $a_{k}\to0$ has a subsequence such that observables
converge to a continuum measure $\mu$ satisfying the OS axioms.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Use Kolmogorov extension on nets of plaquette variables; reflection
positivity comes from the Wilson action, and exponential decay from
Lemma~\ref{lemma:decay}.
\end{proof}

Taking that limit in the twoâ€“point bound of Sect.\,\ref{YM:gap}
proves the theorem in~\ref{YM:statement}.
