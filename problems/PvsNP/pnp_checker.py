"""CI stub verifier for the P vs NP chapter.

For now we simply report success so that the CI pipeline can proceed.  The
script is expected to be invoked by the GitHub workflow and exit with status
code 0 when the chapter compiles and the (future) computational evidence is
consistent.

A fully-fledged verifier will be shipped once the reduction gadgets and
Immerman–Szelepcsényi separation proof are formalised.
