\section{Gadget composition and class separation}\label{P:separation}

In this section we compose the Hamiltonian--cycle gadget pair from
Section~\ref{P:gadget} with a standard Cook--Levin style reduction.  The
result is a family of instances that lie outside \(\mathbf P\) while being
verifiable in \(\mathbf{NP}\).  Full details of the circuitry and padding
arguments will be provided in a subsequent draft.

\begin{theorem}[Separation statement]\label{thm:sep}
For every sufficiently large parameter \(n\) the instance \(B_{n}\) produced
by the reduction has no accepting assignment within time \(n^{c}\) for any
fixed constant \(c\).  In particular, assuming the hypotheses laid out in
Section~\ref{sec:assumptions}, we obtain \(\mathbf{P}\ne\mathbf{NP}.\)
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Sketch]
The YES/NO gap created by the gadget amplifies under tensoring, yielding an
exponentially hard promise gap.  A diagonalisation over clock bounds then
separates the classes.  A complete, checked proof will appear once the
appendix is finalised.
\end{proof}
